# Predictive Modeling of Medical Premium Prices: Analyzing the Influence of Health Attributes and Medical History

## Overview
This project explores the intricate relationship between individual health attributes, medical history, and the pricing of medical premiums. The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates medical premium prices based on a variety of health factors, such as age, chronic conditions, surgeries, and family history of illnesses like cancer. By leveraging regression modeling techniques and a rich dataset, this project aims to identify the key features influencing medical premium prices and their relative importance.

## Research Objectives
- **Accurately Predict Premium Prices**: Predict medical premium costs using individual health attributes and medical history.
- **Analyze Feature Importance**: Determine how different features like age, chronic health conditions, surgeries, and family history of cancer influence the predicted premium prices.
- **Understand Feature Relationships**: Investigate the relationships between medical history, health indicators, and premium prices, focusing on correlations between variables.
- **Develop Regression Models**: Build and evaluate regression models to predict premium prices and assess feature importance.

## Research Questions
1. How accurately can medical premium prices be predicted using individual health attributes and medical history?
2. How significant is age as a predictor, and how does it compare to other health factors?
3. What is the individual and collective influence of chronic health conditions like diabetes and blood pressure on premium prices?
4. How do major surgeries and a family history of cancer affect premium pricing predictions?
5. Which features are most influential in determining medical premium prices?

## Dataset
The dataset comprises individual health records that include the following key features:
- **Age**: Numeric data representing the age of the individual.
- **Chronic Health Conditions**: Information on whether the individual suffers from chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, etc.
- **Major Surgeries**: Records of significant surgeries the individual has undergone.
- **Family History of Cancer**: Information on whether close relatives have had cancer.
- **Medical Premium Price**: The target variable representing the cost of medical premiums.

## Project Goals
- **Data Understanding**: Perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset, focusing on the distribution of variables such as age, health indicators, and premium prices.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze the correlation between different attributes and premium prices, focusing on the influence of medical history on premiums.
- **Predictive Model Development**: Build and optimize regression models to predict medical premium prices using health attributes.
- **Feature Importance**: Identify and rank the most influential features affecting premium pricing.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language used for analysis and model development.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation, exploration, and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization, particularly to analyze feature distributions and relationships.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building regression models, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and iterative model development.
